# Publishing to Other Users

### Leverage Domo to share content and data to other users
Quickly and easily replicate pages and cards from the Publisher instance and share them with customers in a dedicated subscriber instance. Ensure everyone sees the right data, and no more than they are authorized to view using filters and authentication.

#### Domo Publish allows you to:

- Control all the content by filtering to the appropriate data
- Filter data for each subscriber before it is published
- Manage all of your Publish jobs, content, filters and subscribers in one central location
