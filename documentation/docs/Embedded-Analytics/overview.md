### Scalable data distribution â€” start to finish

Share your data and content externally at scale. Distribute personalized dashboards beyond the borders of your own company. Manage publications so only the data that is safe for you and relevant for them gets shared. These interactive dashboards are compatible whether they are embedded in the portals you build, integrated with the software and products you sell, or connected across the instances Domo hosts.

Provide data to customers, partners, and vendors. White label the experience to make your dashboards feel like a native OEM part of your branded application.
