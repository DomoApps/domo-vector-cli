# Embedding Into Sites and Web Portals

**Turn your data into an asset, everywhere.**
Embed Domo Cards privately in SSO-enabled websites, portals, and applications, or publicly on public websites, blogs, and social media platforms. Use the policies you already have set up externally with Programmatic filters in server-side code. Enhance your sites and web portals with live data. Leverage your customer portal logins for each individual user and through filters you can create a personalized experience for each individual user. Foster self-service exploration with filter, drill, and link interactions.

**The Domo Everywhere: Domo Embed feature allows you to:**

- Make your data interactive
- Maintain your brand using your own custom colors and logos
- Embed live data into your sites and portals to enhance your product
