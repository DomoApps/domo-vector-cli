# Managing, Editing, and Saving Your App in the Pro-Code Editor

## Introduction

Once you've set up your workspace and started building your app, it's essential to know how to manage, save, and organize your work. This guide will show you how to edit your app, save different versions, download your code, and manage your app as your project evolves. Following these steps will help you maintain an organized, efficient workflow while developing your application.

### 1. Edit Your App

To make edits to your app, locate it in the **Asset Library**, navigate to the details page, and select the version you want to edit. This ensures you're working with the correct version of your app.

### 5. Switch Between Versions

To move between different versions of your app, use the **version dropdown menu** located to the left of the Save button. This allows you to compare and revert to previous versions if needed.

### 6. Download Your App

If you’d like to download your app's code, go to the **Domo logo dropdown** and select **Download Design**. This will download your project as a ZIP file, making it easy to back up your work or share it with others.

## Conclusion

Effectively managing, editing, and saving your app is crucial for streamlined development and version control. By following these steps, you ensure your app’s progress is well-documented and organized. Now, you can confidently develop and refine your application, knowing that your work is backed up and easy to manage in the Pro-Code Editor.
