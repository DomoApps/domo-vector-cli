# Getting Started with the Pro-Code Editor

## Introduction

The Pro-Code Editor in Domo allows you to create custom applications, enabling more control and flexibility in your design and functionality. Whether you're building a new app from scratch or using a template, this guide will walk you through the initial steps of setting up your app, customizing the editor workspace, and previewing your work.

### 1. Access the Pro-Code Editor

To begin, navigate to the Pro-Code Editor in your Domo instance. You can locate it within the Asset Library by selecting **Pro-Code Apps**.

### 2. Choose a Template

Select a template from the available options to get started with your app. These templates provide various foundational setups, allowing you to jumpstart your development with pre-configured components.

### 3. Name Your App and Set the Version

Give your app a descriptive name and set an initial version number. Establishing a version control strategy from the start will help keep track of updates and changes as your app evolves.

\* *Be aware that when a version is released, that version is locked for viewing only. Each version’s code is distinct, so changes in one version won’t affect others. This allows you to maintain multiple iterations of your app without risking unintended changes across versions.*

### 4. Customize Your Workspace

Personalize your workspace settings:

- **Theme Settings**: To switch themes or disable dark mode (default), click the Domo logo at the top left.
- **File Upload**: Use this menu to upload any additional files needed for your project, such as images or data files. You can also drag and drop files directly from your computer.

### 5. Adjust the Layout

The default layout includes a file explorer, editor, and preview window. You can adjust this setup to match your workflow:

- **Hide/Show File Explorer**: Collapse the file explorer to focus on the editor.

### 8. Set Custom Preview Sizes

If your app requires specific display dimensions, toggle the **Custom Size** switch. Define the width and height values, then click **Update** to apply your changes. This is particularly useful for testing responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes.
