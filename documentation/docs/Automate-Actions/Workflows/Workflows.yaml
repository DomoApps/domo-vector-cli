    This API reference is useful if you are trying to hit workflows from:
    1. An external Domo Instance
    2. A environment from outside of Domo
    2. A script running in Domo's Jupyter Workspaces

    If you are looking to hit a workflow from a Domo App, see the [App Framework API Reference for Workflows](../../Domo-App-APIs/Workflows-API.md) and the [guide on how to hit a workflow from a Domo App](../../Apps/App-Framework/Guides/hitting-a-workflow.md).

    If you are unfamiliar with how to authenticate against Product APIs, [please see this overview page](../../Getting-Started/api-authentication.md).

    For more background on Workflows, check out the [Knowledge Base for an overview](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005108?language=en_US).

            Returns the information about the instance of the Workflow that was just started. The `status` property can take the values `null`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `CANCELED`,  or `COMPLETED`. 

            A status of `null` might be valid. It just means the workflow hasnâ€™t reported back as started yet.

        > These APIs are CORS restricted so should only be called server-side when scripting against Domo. Due to this restriction, the "Try It" functionality in this documentation will not work, but the code snippet it generates (e.g. the curl request) should provided that you replace `YOUR_INSTANCE` and `YOUR_TOKEN` with the appropriate values.

                    The start parameters required to kick off the Workflow. A simple example of a workflow that takes two numerical inputs, might look like the following:
                    ```json
                    {"parameter1": 13, "parameter2": 7}
                    ```

                    #### Input Parameters

                    > For the `data` object containing the start parameters required to run the workflow, be careful to structure this object so it is consistent with the input types that you've already defined in your workflow.
                    >
                    > The valid input type options are:
                    > - `boolean`
                    > - `date`
                    > - `dateTime`
                    > - `decimal`
                    > - `duration`
                    > - `number`
                    > - `object`
                    > - `person`
                    > - `dataset`
                    > - `group`
                    > - `text`
                    > - `time`
                    >
                    > You may pass in lists containing the above types and may also nest additional information in `object` type inputs.
