# Domo AI Resources Guide

The AI Resources Guide is your one-stop shop for all help resources related to Domo AI products. 

Domo offers a suite of AI / data science / machine learning tools to help you do more with your data. These tools include:
- [Domo.AI](ai-services.md)
- [Jupyter Workspaces](jupyter.md)
- [Data Science Accelerators](accelerators.md)
- [Magic ETL R/Python Scripting Tiles (Scripting Tiles)](scripting-tiles.md)
- [Magic ETL Data Science Action Tiles (Action Tiles)](data-science-tiles.md)
- [AutoML](autoML.md)

Help resources in the guide are organized by product, so you can easily view all Knowledge Base articles, how-to videos, and [webinars](webinars.md) on the tool you are interested in.

The AI Resources Guide will be updated over time as more help resources become available. If you have suggestions on other help resources that would be useful to create or topics that should be explored in a webinar, let us know by emailing datascienceSME@domo.com.
