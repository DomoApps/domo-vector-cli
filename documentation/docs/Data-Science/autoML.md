# Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
Machine learning is within everyone’s grasp with Domo’s automated machine learning [AutoML] tool. In partnership with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, AutoML automatically trains and tunes machine learning models based on data provided by a customer. Specifically, with just a few clicks, AutoML will transform your data to be ready for machine learning and launch hundreds of training jobs on any DataSet in Domo to find the model that achieves the best performance for your task. You can then easily deploy the model on your Domo DataSets with the  AutoML Interface tile in Magic ETL.
