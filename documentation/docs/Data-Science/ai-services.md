### Tools and Capabilities
---
#### Data Prep & Analysis 
- [**AI Readiness**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005561?language=en_US): To get the most value from Domo.AI, we recommend preparing your data using AI Readiness. AI Readiness is available in the Details view of every DataSet in the Data Center.
- [**AI Chat**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005539?language=en_US): Domo.AI Chat lets you talk with your data from inside Domo using a familiar chat interface. AI Chat is context-aware, referencing DataSets and cards hosted either by an App Studio app or by the dashboard you are currently viewing. You can access a detailed breakdown of each step the model took to answer your question, and AI Chat also suggests additional questions to help you go deeper. AI Chat is session-specific, storing chats from past sessions that you can view in the chat history. See a [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUpEM9VZUFg?si=qA_2jsEzBR6FRyl6&t=185) or [tips for using AI Chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUpEM9VZUFg?t=857s).
