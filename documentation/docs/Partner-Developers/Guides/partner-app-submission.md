# Partner App Submission Guide

If you do not already have a developer instance, sign up for a free developer trial <a href="/developer-trial-request" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.

Once development is completed for your app and you are ready to submit it to the Domo Appstore, please review the following requirements outlined in this guide. 

## Step 1: Partner App Agreement
Once the decision has been made by the partner to publish an app on the Domo platform, review and sign the Partner App Agreement. After the agreement is signed, a partner instance will be created.  You can access the Partner App Agreement <a href="https://web-assets.domo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Domo-App-Publisher-Program-Agreement-3.2021.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. Please contact <a href="mailto:partners@domo.com">partners@domo.com</a> to help facilitate this process.

## Step 2: Security and engineering best practices
Review the security and engineering best practices documentation linked below. Make sure that you are addressing and complying with all the best practices as you are developing the app.

</ul>

## Step 3: Advanced App Platform
Decide if you want to purchase the advanced app platform for the most seamless development experience. While purchasing this is not a requirement to submit an app to Domo's Appstore, the benefits of having this platform is detailed in the following documents:

</ul>

If there is interest in this feature, please contact your Partner Account Exec (AE), so the Partner AE can work with engineering team to coordinate the technical discussions.

## Step 4: Enable app publishing on partner instance

Make sure that your partner instance (-partner) has app publishing enabled. You will know that app publishing is enabled when there is a + icon on the left navigation bar in the Domo Appstore. If publish is not enabled, send an email with your name and instance URL to <a href="mailto:appsubmissions@domo.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appsubmissions@domo.com</a>.

## Step 5: Understand publishing overview and requirements
For the Domo Appstore overview and requirements, please see documentation [here](../Domo-Marketplace/overview.md).

## Step 6: Request to publish

Once the app is fully developed with adherence to security protocols, proceed to publish the app with all marketing materials including images (ppt) of the app and video. Detailed instructions can be found [here](../Domo-Marketplace/marketplace-submission.md).

The App will go through internal security review with Domo security and operations teams ensuring that all security best practices have been followed. If there are any concerns a Domo representative will alert you to the issues that need to be addressed with your app. You may be required to resubumit your app, if there are changes required to the app due to the security review. Once the security issues are resolved, the app will be published to the Domo Appstore. 

## Step 7: App analytics

Decide if you want to purchase the app analytics. While not required to publish your app, app analytics provides critical data points on the usage of your apps.
