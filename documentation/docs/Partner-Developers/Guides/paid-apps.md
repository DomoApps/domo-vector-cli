# Paid Apps Guide

Selling your apps and managing leads has never been easier with the Publisher Hub and the new Domo Appstore submission process. This page will help teach about <strong>a) listing paid apps, b) app promotions, c) app sales process, d) managing leads, and e) closing and managing orders.</strong>

## Listing Paid Apps
Apps can be listed as either free or paid. Paid apps require selecting "Paid (request quote)" under the "Pricing" option in the app submission window. If you want your app to be free to customers, select the "Free" option in this window.

If "Paid (request quote)" is not selected the app will be submitted as a free app.

## App Sales Process
Customers start the app purchase process by clicking the “Request Quote” button in the top right of the app detail page or in the header of the page where an app has been installed with sample data.

Once a customer clicks on the "Request Quote" button, a lead is generated and managed by the customer's account team. The account team will coordinate demos with the publisher.
