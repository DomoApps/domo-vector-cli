# Building an App Overview

## 1. Define your app
Before you start building, it is best to define the specific value your app will provide to your users. By understanding the challenge, questions, and potential decisions facing your audience, you can provide a solution that has more value, longer shelf life, and brings a better return for you.

<strong>Identify Your Audience</strong>
A key step in building valuable apps is picking a specific audience for your app. Realizing that different business roles ask different questions and as result make different decisions helps guide you in your app building process. What questions do they have? What decisions do they make? How can I make those decisions easier, faster, and more accurate?

<strong>Choose a Business Question</strong>
Now that you have identified your audience, it’s time to think about the business question your app will address. There are many types of questions. All have a place, but those that drive decisions and actions toward a specific goal are typically the best. For example, “How can I increase traffic to my website?” is better than “What is my website traffic?” The former drives the user (and your content) toward an action.

<strong>Identify Key Metrics</strong>
Metrics come in many varieties. Outcome metrics or results metrics tell us how well we are accomplishing our goal. Driver metrics show what factors impact the outcome. And action metrics give specific information that helps business leaders to feed decisions. Identifying the metrics in your app and how they will be used will enable you to focus using the metrics that will have the most value and drive action.

<strong>Tell A Story</strong>
Create a visual narrative that flows from one metric to the next naturally. Anticipate the sequence of questions most users will have and walk them through it so they can get their answers with clarity and efficiency. It will help ensure your users have a good experience beginning with their first use of your app and beyond.

<strong>Determine Feasibility</strong>
Now it’s time to think about the feasibility and data. Once you have decided on your audience, business question, key metrics, and visuals, you can identify the data your app requires and how it can be obtained. Do customers have this data? How will they bring it into Domo? Will transforms be required, if so, what transforms are required? Domo has powerful connect and prepare tools for all types of users, offering a broad range of options. However, the more accessible and simple the data process is, the more people will be successful with your app.

## 2. Get data for your app

App visualizations are powered by datasets that reside in Domo.  One of the first steps to building an app is getting data. This [guide](getting-data-overview.md) on getting data  will walk you through some of the fundamental tools and features to acquire and transform data.


## 3. Build your app

Whether you’re a developer, designer, or a Domo user, you can create insightful custom visualizations using Domo’s App development tools.
