# Appstore Submission

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Note:</strong> </span>The ability to publish content is available by request. If you'd like to submit content to publish in Domo's Appstore, send an email with your name and instance URL to <a href="mailto:appsubmissions@domo.com">appsubmissions@domo.com</a>.

## Checklist
Before you get started here is a list of the requirements you will need for your submission.

**Resources you'll need:**
- A square icon png or jpg format at a minimum of 100 x 100 pixels
- 3-10 jpg or png screenshots at a minimum of 1920 x 1080 pixels
- 1 YouTube video. This is optional but highly recommended to show off your app. You'll paste in its URL.

**What you’ll need to know:**
- Will it be public to all Domo customers or shared only with your company?
- What kind of app is it? Visualization, service, or code block
- What is the pricing model? Free or request a quote
- Is it an app that can be implemented in a few minutes or are you promoting a service?

Please ensure that your app meets all the requirements in the [Appstore Requirements](marketplace-requirements.md) documentation before submitting your app to the Appstore. Apps built using Domo Stories and App Dev Framework will all follow these same procedures.

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> If you are a Domo partner that is building an app, please reference the [Partner App Submission Guide](../Guides/partner-app-submission.md)</strong> before you get started.


## Get Started

To get started login to your Domo instance and go to the Domo Appstore by selecting the Appstore icon in the top navigation.

&nbsp;

Once you are in the Domo Appstore select the **+** icon in the left navigation bar.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-start.png" width="1100" height="" />

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> You will need to be sure you have publishing to the Domo Appstore enabled for you. If you don’t see the <strong>+</strong> icon in the left navigation bar contact us at <a href="mailto:appsubmissions@domo.com">appsubmissions@domo.com</a> to have it turned on.

## Select your app type

Select the type of app you are offering from the dropdown:

- **Dashboard.** Publish a comprehensive solutions for solving a specific business question.
- **Code Block.** Publish a Code Block that will enhance data visualizations with Beast Modes, Jupyter, Python, R, and SQL.
- **Card.** Publish a single visualization.
- **Custom Chart.** Publish a chart that will visualize data in a unique way.
- **Enterprise App.** Publish a set of custom functionality built on top of [Domo’s App Developer Framework](../../Apps/App-Framework/Welcome.md).
- **Service.** Advertise any other service that can help a company or provide functionality for other apps to use.

&nbsp;

You will then need to indicate if your app will be paid, free, public, or only visible to your company, and if it is instant content or a promotional app. 
- **Instant content** can be immediately deployed. Only Dashboards and Code Blocks are supported instant content. 
- **Promotional Apps** require the user to contact you for permission to download. This is used for a more complicated app that also takes some consulting work to install.

If you are submitting a paid app, please refer to the [Paid Apps](../Guides/paid-apps.md) and [Getting Paid](../Guides/getting-paid.md) guides for more information.

## Selecting content

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> When submitting cards, custom charts, enterprise apps, and services you skip this step and go directly to [Name and Info](marketplace-submission.md#name-and-info).
marketplace-submission.md

### **Dashboards:**
Select the page you would like to publish. Your dashboard will then be validated to be sure it is meeting all requirements.

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-page-select-dashboard.png" width="1600" />

### **Code Blocks**
Select your code type and paste in your code selection.

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-select-code-1.png" width="1608" />

&nbsp;

This is an example of a Beast Mode Code Block:

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-select-code-2.png" width="1592" />

## Name and Info

This information should let people identify your submission in the Domo Appstore. You will need to:
- Name your app
- Add a subtitle and description
- Upload an app icon. Recommended size: 200 x 200 pixels

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-name-info-1.png" width="1599" />

&nbsp;

The app description is one area that is part of the first impression for customers but often lacks valuable information and structure. The description piece should give the customer enough information to understand what the app is designed to do for them so they can make a good decision whether this is the right app for them.

## Publishing details
This section allows you to determine who will be able to find your app and make it easier to search for your app. You will need to:
- Input who this app is for, setup effort, and benefits
- Enter up to 4 benefits for your submission

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-publishing-details.png" width="1604"/>

## Appstore Discovery
Add capabilities and tags to allow users to find your submission more easily. 

Select from the following capabilities:
- **Dashboard. Purpose-built packages of reports, charts, and visualizations.
- **Connector. Integrated data from another system into Domo.
- **Enterprise App. Combines data, workflow, alerts, and action into a purpose-built solution.
- **Writeback. Triggers data updates in third party systems and databases.
- **DataFlow. Cleans, transforms, calculates, and combines data.
- **Federated Data. Connects directly to your company data for fast data with no duplication.
- **Data Science. Leverages advanced data science techniques. 
- **Code Block. Pre-built blocks of code to extend and customize Domo.

You can also add up to 10 tags. Be sure to take a look at the [Appstore supported tags](marketplace-requirements.md#supported-tags) if you are unsure what tags to use.

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-appstore-discovery.png" width="1598" />

&nbsp;

Knowing which tags to use and how many to use is always a challenge, but it is worth taking the time in choosing the right tags for your app. The tags are used as a filtering system for the Domo Appstore. Make sure you have at least one tag from the industry, department, activity, and role categories when possible. The connector category is optional but does help your app be displayed when the specific connector is searched.


## Add Media
Upload screenshots or add a link to a YouTube video of your submission. The recommended dimensions of screenshots is 1920x1080 pixels.

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-appstore-submission-media.png" width="1599" />


The screenshot is one of the most common poorly executed steps we see from publishers. By spending just a little more time, you will have a screenshot that gives the customers a great first impression rather than a poor first impression. Follow these steps to take a great screenshot:

- Take a look at the app and put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Do you see anything weird that you should tweak before taking the screenshot?
- Pull up the app on a high-resolution screen if available. Maximize to full screen. Screenshot or crop the app.
- After the screenshot is taken, make sure to hide all personal information on the screenshot including the app owner name and picture, other images of people the page is shared with, etc.
- When submitting code blocks you can add screenshots of code, where it is implemented, or the resulting chart.

## Preview
This allows you to see your app listing. After you review it and everything looks good, click the Submit for Approval button in the bottom right.

## Submission status and approval
Once submitted for approval, someone in your own company (your Major Domo) will get a prompt to approve or deny your submission. Once approved by them your submission will get sent to Domo for approval. It normally takes about 7 days to get a response.

After submission, you can check the status of your app approval by emailing<a href="mailto:appsubmissions@domo.com"> appsubmissions@domo.com</a>.

## Manage Submissions

You can now manage your submissions to the Domo Appstore by status. After logging in, you can access your Store Manager by clicking on the Manage/Gear Icon on the left side of the page.

<img src="https://web-assets.domo.com/miyagi/images/product/product-feature-dev-portal-manage-apps-1.png" width="2073" class="alignnone size-full" />
&nbsp;

On the Store Manager page, you can see your different submissions. Using the status indicators at the top, you can sort by apps that are drafts, pending (from your company), pending Domo approval, live, or denied. You can also select the dropdown menu on each app to see options for deleting an app.

## Resubmission

You will be provided with reasons why your app is being denied. You can review the app submission requirements, make any changes if required, and resubmit the app for approval or contact Customer Support for additional help.
