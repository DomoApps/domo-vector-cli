# SSO

**Simplify the sign-in process using your existing SSO provider.**

Grant access by role with Active Directory integration and manage permissions at scale with APIs. Integrate with top identity providers to control access based on pre-defined user groups. Get more control over Domo users and groups by enabling Domo Single Sign-On using a variety of applications, including AD FS, PingIdentity, and others.

**To set up SSO with Domo you can:**
- Use SAML and OpenID solutions
- Enable SSO with PingIdentity, Google, Okta, Azure and others
- Configure SSO using Metadata Upload, Setup Wizard, or Manual Setup
