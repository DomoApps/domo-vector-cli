# Overview

Domo delivers optimized web-scale enterprise-class governance, security, and administration for businesses of all sizes. Leveraging Domo's OAuth APIs allows you to efficiently govern data access and set administration policies based on identity information gathered from roles, groups, attributes, preferences, and filters.

### Security
---
- **[PDP:](pdp.md)** Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) allows you to easily adjust and customize what data users can view and use within Domo.

- **[Groups:](security.md)** Groups are used within Domo to provide an easy way to grant access to specified content and conversations to all members of a group. The [Group API](../API-Reference/Domo-APIs/Group-API.yaml) allows you to add and remove users, create, delete,  and retrieve a user or a list of users in a group and update user information. This API makes managing and leveraging groups within Domo effortless and efficient. 

- **[SSO:](sso.md)** Simplify the sign-on and security process by leveraging your existing SSO provider to manage your Domo users and permissions.

### Administration
---
- **[Managing Datasets:](data-management.md)** Data is the foundation to making informed business decisions that allows you to take action. Data management is made easy through the [DataSet API](../API-Reference/Domo-APIs/DataSet-API.yaml), which allows you to create, import, export, and manage DataSets and permissions for DataSets within Domo.

- **[Managing Content:](content-management.md)** Pages in Domo are a collection of data visualizations that tell your data story on a screen. To manage this content, you can leverage the [Page API](content-management.md), which allows you to create, delete, and retrieve a page or a list of pages and update page information and content.

- **[Managing Users:](user-management.md)** User objects allow you to manage a user and the userâ€™s attributes such as a department, phone number, employee number, email, and username. The [User API](user-management.md) allows you to create, delete, retrieve a user or a list of users, and update user information.

- **[Activity Log:](activity-log.md)** The activity log stores data including; card and page views, cards created, and users' login data. The [Activity Log API](activity-log.md) enables the retrieval of activity log entries from your Domo instance so that you can monitor and track Domo activity.
