# Buzz API

The Buzz Integration API, allows configuring two-way communication between Buzz and a service outside of Domo.

A Buzz integration is a service hosted outside of Domoâ€™s infrastructure that can receive events from Buzz, and can post messages to Buzz. To use this feature, invoke this API to register an integration, then create one or more event subscriptions for the integration. When a corresponding event occur, Buzz will POST an HTTP request using the configured URL and headers.

Each integration is configured to be active on one or more channels, based on the `scope` field described below. An integration is also configured with headers to be included with each HTTP POST that Buzz sends to the integration, for authentication or other purposes.

Event subscriptions specify the type of event, along with a URL that will be used to POST the event. The URL must start with `https://`, no other protocol is supported.

Events are sent as a JSON payload. The payload includes details about the event as documented below, including a `callback` field with a URL and headers that can be used to post a message back to the originating Buzz channel. Such messages will appear with the name of the integration.
